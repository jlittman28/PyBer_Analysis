# PyBer_Analysis

# Overview of the analysis
  As the barrier to entry is relatively low and more companies continue to enter the ride-sharing market, analyzing underlying ride-share data is necessary to maintain a competitive edge. We were tasked with providing to PyBer a breakdown of key metrics by city type and how the data can be used to make informed decisions about the market.

# Results

## Analysis of the results
Out of the three data sets, Rural areas rank lowest in total rides and drivers, whereas Urban areas rank highest for total rides and drivers. There is a direct correlation between highest/lowest fares and highest/lowest rides.

## Ride-Sharing Data:
In order to aggregate the ride sharing ouput table shown below, we needed to create a new dataframe that consolidated multiple series. See Summary_DataFrame screenshot

# Summary
  
  Based on the above analysis ride sharing output and multiple line graph:
  1. There is an opportunity to break into the rural area market
  2. Look to hire more drivers around the February/March time frame, as the data clearly shows peak Fare's
  3. Would look to add an additional data point around vehicle sizes and quality. In Urban cities, riders may be more inclined to ride in a newer class vehicle which can contribute to an overall increase in total fares.
